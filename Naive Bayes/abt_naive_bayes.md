# Naive Bayes Classifier

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier. The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It is particularly useful for text classification tasks and has been widely used in various applications.

## Naive Bayes Algorithm

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It makes the assumption that the features used to describe an observation are conditionally independent, given the class label. This assumption simplifies the calculation of probabilities and makes the algorithm computationally efficient.

### How it works:

1. **Training:**
   - Calculate the prior probability of each class based on the training data.
   - For each feature, calculate the likelihood of that feature occurring given each class.
   - Multiply the prior probability and the likelihood for each class to get the posterior probability.

2. **Prediction:**
   - For a new observation, calculate the posterior probability for each class.
   - Assign the class with the highest posterior probability as the predicted class.

## Features

- Easy-to-understand Python implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm.
- Support for both binary and multiclass classification.
- Simple API for training the model and making predictions.

## Usage
1. Text Classification:
  -Naive Bayes is commonly used for spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and topic classification in natural language processing tasks.

2. Medical Diagnosis:
 =It has been applied to medical diagnosis tasks, such as classifying a patient's condition based on symptoms.

3. Recommendation Systems:
  -Naive Bayes can be used for building simple recommendation systems, predicting user preferences based on historical data.

### Installation

```bash
pip install naive-bayes-classifier
