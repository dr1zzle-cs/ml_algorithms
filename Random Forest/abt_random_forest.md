# Random Forest Classifier

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Random Forest classifier. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

## Random Forest Algorithm

Random Forest operates by building multiple decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes predicted by individual trees. It introduces randomness in the training process by:
- Subsampling the dataset to train each tree (Bootstrap Aggregating or Bagging).
- Considering only a random subset of features at each split in the decision tree.

### How it works:

1. **Training:**
   - Build multiple decision trees using different subsets of the training data.
   - Randomly select a subset of features at each split.
   - Combine the predictions of individual trees through voting (classification) or averaging (regression).

2. **Prediction:**
   - For a new observation, pass it through each tree and aggregate the results.

## Features

- Python implementation of the Random Forest algorithm.
- Support for both classification and regression tasks.
- Configurable hyperparameters for fine-tuning model performance.

## Usage
1. Classification:
  -Random Forest is effective for classification tasks, such as spam detection, image classification, and credit scoring.

2. Regression:
  -It can be applied to regression problems like predicting house prices, stock prices, or any continuous variable.

3. Feature Importance:
  -Random Forest can be used to assess the importance of different features in the dataset.

### Installation

```bash
pip install random-forest-classifier
