# Decision Tree Classifier

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Decision Tree classifier. Decision Trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They recursively split the data based on the most significant feature at each node to create a tree-like structure.

## Decision Tree Algorithm

Decision Trees make decisions based on asking a series of questions, where each question leads to a conclusion. The algorithm selects the best feature to split the data at each node, making decisions based on the feature values.

### How it works:

1. **Training:**
   - Select the best feature to split the data based on a criterion (e.g., Gini impurity, information gain).
   - Recursively apply this process to create a tree structure.

2. **Prediction:**
   - Traverse the tree by answering questions at each node until reaching a leaf node.
   - The class or value associated with the leaf node is the prediction.

## Features

- Python implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm.
- Support for both classification and regression tasks.
- Configurable hyperparameters for controlling tree depth, splitting criteria, etc.

## Usage

1. Classification:
  -Decision Trees are widely used for classification tasks, such as spam detection, disease diagnosis, and customer churn prediction.

2. Regression:
  -They can be applied to regression problems like predicting house prices, stock prices, or any continuous variable.

3. Feature Importance:
  -Decision Trees can help identify the most important features in the dataset.

### Installation

```bash
pip install decision-tree-classifier
